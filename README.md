# Advent of Code 2021

Each day in different programming language:

## Journal

### Day 1: [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

### Day 2: [Natalie](https://natalie-lang.org/), Ruby implementation, compiled to C++, by Tim Morgan.

Getting Natalie to work was quite easy, even though I know nothing about Ruby and it's ecosystem. This lead to [making pull request to the compiler](https://github.com/seven1m/natalie/pull/261). Natalie in this moment does not support readlines method so I needed to write quick version myself. Will later contribute less hacky implementation.
